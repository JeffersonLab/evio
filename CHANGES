jevio-4.3.1.jar differences from jevio-4.3.jar :

    1) check lengths when parsing evio so bad values are caught if possible

    2) fix bug if trying to unpack strings from rawbytes with too few bytes

    3) fix bug which did not take padding into account when getting data buffer of EvioNode

    4) fix bug in which after adding a structure with EvioCompactStructureHandler,
       the node list was not updated

jevio-4.3.2.jar differences from previous jars :

    1) fix bug in which the displayed event # in graphical viewer did not correspond
       to the actual event number (bug was in EvioReader)

    2) fix bug in which the "next" button in graphical viewer did silly things when
       at max event number

    3) made members of EventTreeMenu protected instead of package or private
       scope for subclassing purposes

jevio-4.4.jar

    -improve performance including replacing LinkedLists with ArrayLists or arrays
    -fix bug in EvioCompactStructureHandler.getNodes() throwing NullPointerException (12/8/14)
    -add constructor to EvioCompactStructureHandler with EvioNode argument (12/8/14)
    -in EvioReader, bomb proof against bad format files, fix bug in which last block's events
     are not indexed, reduce initial memory usage (12/10/14)

jevio-4.4.1.jar

    -fix major bug in ByteDataTransformer.toByteArray(). If arg is a ByteBuffer obtained from
     slice(), its backing array cannot be used to copy into byte array since it copies wrong
     data! (1/8/2015)
    -fix major bug in EvioCompactStructureHandler.getData() which did not account for padding
     in byte and short data (1/8/2015)

jevio-4.4.2.jar

    -fix bug in EventParser & EvioEvent that add other evio structures when EvioReader.parseEvent()
     or EventParser.parseEvent() are called more than once on an event.

future jevio-4.4.3.jar
    -fix bug in parsing composite data in which N=0 acts as N=1.
    -add EventWriter.writeEvent() method for EvioNode object


evio-4.4
