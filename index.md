# **EVIO 6.0 SOFTWARE PACKAGE**
----------------------------

EVIO stands for **EV**ent **I**nput/**O**utput and contains libraries which read & write
data in its own unique format. It was created by the Data Acquisition (DAQ) group
and is now maintained by the Experimental Physics Software and Computing Infrastructure
(EPSCI) group at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).
It was originally used in the online DAQ as part of the CODA software,
but is now being used offline and in other applications as well.

There are C, C++, and Java libraries and a few utility programs as well.
There is an additional package containing a GUI for looking at
evio format data at the byte level. Following are a few relevant links:
