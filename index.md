# **EVIO 6.0 SOFTWARE PACKAGE**
----------------------------

EVIO stands for EVent Input/Output and contains libraries which read & write
data in its own unique format. It was created by the Data Acquisition (DAQ) group
and is now maintained by the Experimental Physics Software and Computing Infrastructure
(EPSCI) group at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).
It was originally used in the online DAQ as part of the CODA software,
but is now being used offline and in other applications as well.

There is a C library as well as an independent C++ library which
is a port from the Java version. There are a few utility programs included.
The Java version is a library with an extensive, user-friendly
interface. There is an additional package containing a GUI for looking at
evio format data at the byte level.

If you only plan to run C/C++ applications you can skip the Java
installation. If you only plan to use Java applications you can
you can skip the C/C++ installation.
